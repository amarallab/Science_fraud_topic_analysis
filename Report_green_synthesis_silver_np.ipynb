The fraction of articles that are classified as reviews shows a broad peak from 2005 to 2015 that somewhat hides a steadily increasing trend. Of greater concern, the fraction of articles retracted has shows a peak but in the 2010 to 2015 period. Probably related to these two peaks, there is a peak in the fraction of studies with published between 2015 and 2015. \n",
