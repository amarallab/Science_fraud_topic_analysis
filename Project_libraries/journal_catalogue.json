M\u00c9THODES: Des \u00e9tudes de tomodensitom\u00e9tries (TDM) thoraciques effectu\u00e9es chez 303 patients cons\u00e9cutifs suspects de COVID-19 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9es par 3 radiologistes thoraciques form\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019un fellowship. Chaque cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9 selon sa forme (typique, ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, atypique ou n\u00e9gatif) pour la pneumonie COVID-19 en suivant les lignes directrices pour leur signalement tir\u00e9es de la d\u00e9claration de consensus d\u2019experts de la RSNA; une analyse inter-observateurs a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e. Les caract\u00e9ristiques objectives des TDM associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la pneumonie COVID-19 et la r\u00e9partition des constatations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9es. R\u00c9SULTATS: Le kappa de Fleiss pour tous les observateurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 presque parfait pour toutes les formes typiques (0,815), atypiques (0,806) et n\u00e9gatives (0,962) de COVID-19 (P < 0,0001) et substantiel (0,636) pour les formes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es de COVID-19 (P < 0,0001). L\u2019analyse V de Cramer a montr\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s fortes corr\u00e9lations entre toutes les interpr\u00e9tations des radiologistes, avec une signification statistique pour toutes les formes (typiques, ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es, atypiques et n\u00e9gatives) de COVID-19 (P < 0,001). Les constatations objectives \u00e0 l\u2019imagerie par TDM ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9es avec des pourcentages semblables de cas typiques par tous les observateurs. CONCLUSION: La d\u00e9claration de consensus d\u2019experts de la RSNA pour le signalement des constatations \u00e0 la TDM thoracique en rapport avec la COVID-19 d\u00e9montre une concordance substantielle \u00e0 presque parfaite entre les radiologistes thoraciques dans une cohorte relativement importante de patients ayant une infection COVID-19 suspect\u00e9e cliniquement. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence fiable permettant aux radiologistes de communiquer avec exactitude leur niveau de soup\u00e7on en se basant sur la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments objectifs reposant sur des donn\u00e9es probantes Copyright \u00a9 2016 Canadian Association of Radiologists.
