Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms21228790,The Immune Functions of Keratinocytes in Skin Wound Healing,"As the most dominant cell type in the skin, keratinocytes play critical roles in wound repair not only as structural cells but also exerting important immune functions. This review focuses on the communications between keratinocytes and immune cells in wound healing, which are mediated by various cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles. Keratinocytes can also directly interact with T cells via antigen presentation. Moreover, keratinocytes produce antimicrobial peptides that can directly kill the invading pathogens and contribute to wound repair in many aspects. We also reviewed the epigenetic mechanisms known to regulate keratinocyte immune functions, including histone modifications, non-protein-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs, and long noncoding RNAs), and chromatin dynamics. Lastly, we summarized the current evidence on the dysregulated immune functions of keratinocytes in chronic nonhealing wounds. Based on their crucial immune functions in skin wound healing, we propose that keratinocytes significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic wound inflammation. We hope this review will trigger an interest in investigating the immune roles of keratinocytes in chronic wound pathology, which may open up new avenues for developing innovative wound treatments.",review,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms21228435,Eicosanoids in Skin Wound Healing,"Wound healing is an important process in the human body to protect against external threats. A dysregulation at any stage of the wound healing process may result in the development of various intractable ulcers or excessive scar formation. Numerous factors such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines are involved in this process and play vital roles in tissue repair. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that lipid mediators derived from membrane fatty acids are also involved in the process of wound healing. Among these lipid mediators, we focus on eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxane, leukotrienes, and specialized pro-resolving mediators, which are produced during wound healing processes and play versatile roles in the process. This review article highlights the roles of eicosanoids on skin wound healing, especially focusing on the biosynthetic pathways and biological functions, i.e., inflammation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, remodeling, and scarring.",review,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms22084121,The Role of Porphyrinoid Photosensitizers for Skin Wound Healing,"Microorganisms, usually bacteria and fungi, grow and spread in skin wounds, causing infections. These infections trigger the immune system and cause inflammation and tissue damage within the skin or wound, slowing down the healing process. The use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to eradicate microorganisms has been regarded as a promising alternative to anti-infective therapies, such as those based on antibiotics, and more recently, is being considered for skin wound-healing, namely for infected wounds. Among the several molecules exploited as photosensitizers (PS), porphyrinoids exhibit suitable features for achieving those goals efficiently. The capability that these macrocycles display to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) gives a significant contribution to the regenerative process. ROS are responsible for avoiding the development of infections by inactivating microorganisms such as bacteria but also by promoting cell proliferation through the activation of stem cells which regulates inflammatory factors and collagen remodeling. The PS can act solo or combined with several materials, such as polymers, hydrogels, nanotubes, or metal-organic frameworks (MOF), keeping both the microbial photoinactivation and healing/regenerative processes' effectiveness. This review highlights the developments on the combination of PDT approach and skin wound healing using natural and synthetic porphyrinoids, such as porphyrins, chlorins and phthalocyanines, as PS, as well as the prodrug 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), the natural precursor of protoporphyrin-IX (PP-IX).",review,suspicious
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24097895,Potential Role of AGR2 for Mammalian Skin Wound Healing,"The limited ability of mammals to regenerate has garnered significant attention, particularly in regard to skin wound healing (WH), which is a critical step for regeneration. In human adults, skin WH results in the formation of scars following injury or trauma, regardless of severity. This differs significantly from the scarless WH observed in the fetal skin of mammals or anamniotes. This review investigates the role of molecular players involved in scarless WH, which are lost or repressed in adult mammalian WH systems. Specifically, we analyze the physiological role of Anterior Gradient (AGR) family proteins at different stages of the WH regulatory network. AGR is activated in the regeneration of lower vertebrates at the stage of wound closure and, accordingly, is important for WH. Mammalian AGR2 is expressed during scarless WH in embryonic skin, while in adults, the activity of this gene is normally inhibited and is observed only in the mucous epithelium of the digestive tract, which is capable of full regeneration. The combination of AGR2 unique potencies in postnatal mammals makes it possible to consider it as a promising candidate for enhancing WH processes.",review,suspicious
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms21145092,Carbonic Anhydrase VI in Skin Wound Healing Study on Car6 Knockout Mice,"Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) contribute to tumor cell migration by generating an acidic environment through the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and a proton. CA VI is secreted to milk and saliva, and it could contribute to wound closure, as a potential trophic factor, in animals that typically lick their wounds. Our aim was to investigate whether human CA VI improves skin-wound healing in full-thickness skin-wound models. The effect was studied in Car6 -/- knockout mice and wild type littermates. Half of both mice strains were given topically administered, milk-derived CA VI after wounding and eight hours later. The amount of topically given CA VI exceeded the predicted amount of natural saliva-delivered CA VI. The healing was followed for seven days and studied from photographs and histological sections. Our results showed no significant differences between the treatment groups in wound closure, re-epithelization, or granulation tissue formation, nor did the Car6 genotype affect the healing. Our results demonstrate that CA VI does not play a major role in skin-wound healing and also suggest that saliva-derived CA VI is not responsible for the licking-associated improved wound healing in animals.",experimental,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24043839,Dipotassium Glycyrrhizininate Improves Skin Wound Healing by Modulating Inflammatory Process,"Wound healing is characterized by a systemic and complex process of cellular and molecular activities. Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate (DPG), a side product derived from glycyrrhizic acid, has several biological effects, such as being antiallergic, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, gastroprotective, antitumoral, and anti-inflammatory. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of topical DPG on the healing of cutaneous wounds by secondary intention in an in vivo experimental model. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were used in the experiment, and were randomly divided into six groups of four. Circular excisions were performed and topically treated for 14 days after wound induction. Macroscopic and histopathological analyses were performed. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time qPCR. Our results showed that treatment with DPG caused a decrease in the inflammatory exudate as well as an absence of active hyperemia. Increases in granulation tissue, tissue reepithelization, and total collagen were also observed. Furthermore, DPG treatment reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf-α, Cox-2, Il-8, Irak-2, Nf-kB, and Il-1) while increasing the expression of Il-10, demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects across all three treatment periods. Based on our results, we conclude that DPG attenuates the inflammatory process by promoting skin wound healing through the modulation of distinct mechanisms and signaling pathways, including anti-inflammatory ones. This involves modulation of the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression; promotion of new granulation tissue; angiogenesis; and tissue re-epithelialization, all of which contribute to tissue remodeling.",experimental - 24 male Wistar rats,number of rats is suspicious
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms20143381,Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Facilitates Skin Wound Healing by Increasing Angiogenesis and Inflammatory Cell Recruitment with Less Scar Formation,"Wound healing starts with the recruitment of inflammatory cells that secrete wound-related factors. This step is followed by fibroblast activation and tissue construction. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a lipid mediator that promotes angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and attracts immune cells. We investigated the roles of S1P in skin wound healing by altering the expression of its biogenic enzyme, sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1). The murine excisional wound splinting model was used. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) was highly expressed in murine wounds and that SphK1-/- mice exhibit delayed wound closure along with less angiogenesis and inflammatory cell recruitment. Nanoparticle-mediated topical SphK1 overexpression accelerated wound closure, which associated with increased angiogenesis, inflammatory cell recruitment, and various wound-related factors. The SphK1 overexpression also led to less scarring, and the interaction between transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and S1P receptor-2 (S1PR2) signaling is likely to play a key role. In summary, SphK1 play important roles to strengthen immunity, and contributes early wound healing with suppressed scarring. S1P can be a novel therapeutic molecule with anti-scarring effect in surgical, trauma, and chronic wound management.",experimental,suspicious
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms20102579,Effects of Sapindus mukorossi Seed Oil on Skin Wound Healing: In Vivo and in Vitro Testing,"Sapindus mukorossi seed oil is commonly used as a source for biodiesel fuel. Its phytochemical composition is similar to the extracted oil from Sapindus trifoliatus seeds, which exhibit beneficial effects for skin wound healing. Since S. mukorossi seed shows no cyanogenic property, it could be a potential candidate for the treatment of skin wounds. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of S. mukorossi seed oil in the treatment of skin wounds. We characterized and quantified the fatty acids and unsaponifiable fractions (including β-sitosterol and δ-tocopherol) contained in S. mukorossi seed-extracted oil by GC-MS and HPLC, respectively. Cell proliferation and migratory ability were evaluated by cell viability and scratch experiments using CCD-966SK cells treated with S. mukorossi oil. The anti-inflammatory effects of the oil were evaluated by measuring the nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Antimicrobial activity tests were performed with Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans using a modified Japanese Industrial Standard procedure. Uniform artificial wounds were created on the dorsum of rats. The wounds were treated with a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)/hyaluronic acid (HA)/sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel for releasing the S. mukorossi seed oil. The wound sizes were measured photographically for 12 days and were compared to wounds covered with analogous membranes containing a saline solution. Our results showed that the S. mukorossi seed oil used in this study contains abundant monounsaturated fatty acids, β-sitosterol, and δ-tocopherol. In the in vitro tests, S. mukorossi seed oil prompted cell proliferation and migration capability. Additionally, the oil had significant anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities. In the in vivo animal experiments, S. mukorossi seed oil-treated wounds revealed acceleration of sequential skin wound healing events after two days of healing. The size of oil-treated wound decreased to half the size of the untreated control after eight days of healing. The results suggest that S. mukorossi seed oil could be a potential source for promoting skin wound healing.",experimental,suspicious
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241411831,Anti-Inflammatory and Histological Analysis of Skin Wound Healing through Topical Application of Mexican Propolis,"Skin wound healing is a complex biochemical process of tissue repair and remodeling in response to injury. Currently, the drugs used to improve the healing process are inaccessible to the population, are costly, and have side effects, making the search for new treatment alternatives necessary. Propolis is a natural product produced by bees that is widely recognized and used in folk medicine for its multiple biomedical activities. However, therapeutic information regarding Mexican propolis is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the wound-healing effect of the Chihuahua ethanolic extract of propolis (ChEEP). Macroscopic and histological analyses were performed using a mouse wound-healing model. The topic acute toxicity assay showed that propolis at 10% w/v had no toxic effects. ChEEP has antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Moreover, it exhibited good anti-inflammatory activity evaluated through mouse ear edema induced by 12-O-tetradeca-noylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). A full-thickness incision lesion was created in mice and treated topically with 10% ChEEP. At Day 14 post-treatment, it was observed that propolis increased wound contraction and reduced healing time and wound length; furthermore, propolis increased the tensile strength of the wound, as determined with the tensiometric method, and promoted the formation of type I collagen at the site of injury, as evaluated with Herovici stain. These findings suggest that the topical administration of ChEEP can improve skin wound healing, probably due to the synergistic effect of its components, mainly polyphenols, in different steps of the wound-healing process. It should be noted this is the first time that the wound-healing activity of a Mexican propolis has been evaluated.",experimental,suspicious no mention of number of mice in experiment
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms23116289,Preparation of Recombinant Human Collagen III Protein Hydrogels with Sustained Release of Extracellular Vesicles for Skin Wound Healing,"Existing treatment methods encounter difficulties in effectively promoting skin wound healing, making this a serious challenge for clinical treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by stem cells have been proven to contribute to the regeneration and repair of wound tissue, but they cannot be targeted and sustained, which seriously limits their current therapeutic potential. The recombinant human collagen III protein (rhCol III) has the advantages of good water solubility, an absence of hidden viral dangers, a low rejection rate and a stable production process. In order to achieve a site-specific sustained release of EVs, we prepared a rhCol III hydrogel by cross-linking with transglutaminase (TGase) from Streptomyces mobaraensis, which has a uniform pore size and good biocompatibility. The release profile of the rhCol III-EVs hydrogel confirmed that the rhCol III hydrogel could slowly release EVs into the external environment. Herein, the rhCol III-EVs hydrogel effectively promoted macrophage changing from type M1 to type M2, the migration ability of L929 cells and the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the rhCol III-EVs hydrogel is shown to promote wound healing by inhibiting the inflammatory response and promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis in a diabetic rat skin injury model. The reported results indicate that the rhCol III-EVs hydrogel could be used as a new biological material for EV delivery, and has a significant application value in skin wound healing.",experimental,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms18081614,The Pharmaceutical Device Prisma(®) Skin Promotes in Vitro Angiogenesis through Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition during Skin Wound Healing,"Glycosaminoglycans are polysaccharides of the extracellular matrix supporting skin wound closure. Mesoglycan is a mixture of glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin-, dermatan-, heparan-sulfate and heparin and is the main component of Prisma® Skin, a pharmaceutical device developed by Mediolanum Farmaceutici S.p.a. Here, we show the in vitro effects of this device in the new vessels formation by endothelial cells, since angiogenesis represents a key moment in wound healing. We found a strong increase of migration and invasion rates of these cells treated with mesoglycan and Prisma® Skin which mediate the activation of the pathway triggered by CD44 receptor. Furthermore, endothelial cells form longer capillary-like structures with a great number of branches, in the presence of the same treatments. Thus, the device, thanks to the mesoglycan, leads the cells to the Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition, suggesting the switch to a fibroblast-like phenotype, as shown by immunofluorescence assays. Finally, we found that mesoglycan and Prisma® Skin inhibit inflammatory reactions such as nitric oxide secretion and NF-κB nuclear translocation in endothelial cells and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α production by macrophages. In conclusion, based on our data, we suggest that Prisma® Skin may be able to accelerate angiogenesis in skin wound healing, and regulate inflammation avoiding chronic, thus pathological, responses.",experimental,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms20205086,Gene Expression Profiling of the Extracellular Matrix Signature in Macrophages of Different Activation Status: Relevance for Skin Wound Healing,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural support for tissue architecture and is a major effector of cell behavior during skin repair and inflammation. Macrophages are involved in all stages of skin repair but only limited knowledge exists about macrophage-specific expression and regulation of ECM components. In this study, we used transcriptome profiling and bioinformatic analysis to define the unique expression of ECM-associated genes in cultured macrophages. Characterization of the matrisome revealed that most genes were constitutively expressed and that several genes were uniquely regulated upon interferon gamma (IFNγ) and dexamethasone stimulation. Among those core matrisome and matrisome-associated components transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-induced, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), elastin microfibril interfacer (EMILIN)-1, netrin-1 and gliomedin were also present within the wound bed at time points that are characterized by profound macrophage infiltration. Hence, macrophages are a source of ECM components in vitro as well as during skin wound healing, and identification of these matrisome components is a first step to understand the role and therapeutic value of ECM components in macrophages and during wound healing.",experimental,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241210295,Do Curdlan Hydrogels Improved with Bioactive Compounds from Hop Exhibit Beneficial Properties for Skin Wound Healing,"Chronic wounds, among others, are mainly characterized by prolonged inflammation associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. As a consequence, this phenomenon hinders or even precludes the regeneration process. It is known that biomaterials composed of biopolymers can significantly promote the process of wound healing and regeneration. The aim of this study was to establish whether curdlan-based biomaterials modified with hop compounds can be considered as promising candidates for the promotion of skin wound healing. The resultant biomaterials were subjected to an evaluation of their structural, physicochemical, and biological in vitro and in vivo properties. The conducted physicochemical analyses confirmed the incorporation of bioactive compounds (crude extract or xanthohumol) into the curdlan matrix. It was found that the curdlan-based biomaterials improved with low concentrations of hop compounds possessing satisfactory hydrophilicity, wettability, porosity, and absorption capacities. In vitro, tests showed that these biomaterials were non-cytotoxic, did not inhibit the proliferation of skin fibroblasts, and had the ability to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 by human macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that these biomaterials were biocompatible and could promote the regeneration process after injury (study on Danio rerio larvae model). Thus, it is worth emphasizing that this is the first paper demonstrating that a biomaterial based on a natural biopolymer (curdlan) improved with hop compounds may have biomedical potential, especially in the context of skin wound healing and regeneration.",experimental,

Both tissues have developed intrinsic mechanisms that protect the organism from a wide range of external threats, but at the same time also enable rapid restoration of tissue integrity and organ-specific function. The easy accessibility makes the skin an attractive model system to study tissue damage and repair. Findings from skin research have contributed to unravelling novel fundamental principles in regenerative biology and the repair of other epithelial-mesenchymal tissues, such as the cornea. Following barrier disruption, the influx of inflammatory cells, myofibroblast differentiation, extracellular matrix synthesis and scar formation present parallel repair mechanisms in cornea and skin wound healing. Yet, capillary sprouting, while pivotal in proper skin wound healing, is a process that is rather associated with pathological repair of the cornea. Understanding the parallels and differences of the cellular and molecular networks that coordinate the wound healing response in skin and cornea are likely of mutual importance for both organs with regard to the development of regenerative therapies and understanding of the disease pathologies that affect epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Here, we review the principal events in corneal wound healing and the mechanisms to restore corneal transparency and barrier function.

The in vitro and in vivo skin wound healing effects of gintonin remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of gintonin on wound healing-linked responses, especially migration and proliferation, in skin keratinocytes HaCaT. In this study, 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay, Boyden chamber migration assay, scratch wound healing assay, and Western blot assay were performed. A tail wound mouse model was used for the in vivo test. Gintonin increased proliferation, migration, and scratch closure in HaCaT cells. It also increased the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HaCaT cells. However, these increases, induced by gintonin, were markedly blocked by treatment with Ki16425, an LPA inhibitor, PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester), a calcium chelator, and U73122, a PLC inhibitor. The VEGF receptor inhibitor axitinib also attenuated gintonin-enhanced HaCaT cell proliferation. Gintonin increased the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in HaCaT cells. In addition, gintonin improved tail wound healing in mice. These results indicate that gintonin may promote wound healing through LPA receptor activation and/or VEGF release-mediated downstream signaling pathways. Thus, gintonin could be a beneficial substance to facilitate skin wound healing.",,suspicious   hypothesis

The effectiveness of PDT in skin treatments is associated with the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by a photosensitizer (PS), which acts as a ""double agent"". The release of ROS must be high enough to prevent microbial growth and, simultaneously, to accelerate the immune system response by recruiting important regenerative agents to the wound site. The growing interest in this subject is reflected by the increasing number of studies concerning the optimization of relevant experimental parameters for wound healing via PDT, namely, light features, the structure and concentration of the PS, and the wound type and location. Considering the importance of developing PSs with suitable features for this emergent topic concerning skin wound healing, in this review, a special focus on the achievements attained for each PS class, namely, of the non-porphyrinoid type, is given.",review,

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) contains multiple growth factors (GFs) and shows a significant capacity to heal soft tissue wounds. However, these GFs have a short half-life and deactivate rapidly; we therefore need a sustained delivery system to overcome this shortcoming. In this study, poly(d,l-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(d,l-lactide) (PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA: PLEL) hydrogel was successfully created as delivery vehicle for PRP GFs and was evaluated systematically. PLEL hydrogel was injectable at room temperature and exhibited a smart thermosensitive in situ gel-formation behavior at body temperature. In vitro cell culture showed PRP-loaded PLEL hydrogel (PRP/PLEL) had little cytotoxicity, and promoted EaHy926 proliferation, migration and tube formation; the factor release assay additionally indicated that PLEL realized the controlled release of PRP GFs for as long as 14 days. When employed to treat rodents' full-thickness skin defects, PRP/PLEL showed a significantly better ability to raise the number of both newly formed and mature blood vessels compared to the control, PLEL and PRP groups. Furthermore, the PRP/PLEL-treated group displayed faster wound closure, better reepithelialization and collagen formation.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently isolated from chronic wounds and is thought to be a cause of delayed wound healing. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, unique lymphocytes with a potent regulatory ability in various inflammatory responses, accelerate the wound healing process. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of iNKT cells in the host defense against P. aeruginosa inoculation at the wound sites. We analyzed the re-epithelialization, bacterial load, accumulation of leukocytes, and production of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. In iNKT cell-deficient (Jα18KO) mice, re-epithelialization was significantly decreased, and the number of live colonies was significantly increased, when compared with those in wild-type (WT) mice on day 7. IL-17A, and IL-22 production was significantly lower in Jα18KO mice than in WT mice on day 5. Furthermore, the administration of α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a specific activator of iNKT cells, led to enhanced host protection, as shown by reduced bacterial load, and to increased production of IL-22, IL-23, and S100A9 compared that of with WT mice.

However, the studies concerning its molecular regulation are limited. In the present paper, we ask whether the introduction of two transcription factors, Foxn1 and Hif-1α, into the post-wounded skin of Foxn1-/- mice regulates dWAT during wound healing (days 3 and 6). We have chosen lentivirus vectors (LVs) as a tool to deliver Foxn1 and Hif-1α into the post-wounded skin. We documented that combinations of both transgenes reduces the number, size and diameter of dermal adipocytes at the wound bed area. The qRT-PCR analysis of pro-adipogenic genes, revealed that LV-Hif-1α alone, or combined with LV-Foxn1, increases the mRNA expression of Pparγ, Glut 4 and Fasn at post-wounding day 6. However, the most spectacular stimulatory effect of Foxn1 and/or Hif-1α was observed for Igf2, the growth factor participating in adipogenic signal transduction. Our data also shows that Foxn1/Hif-1α, at post-wounding day 3, reduces levels of CD68 and MIP-1γ mRNA expression and the percentage of CD68 positive cells in the wound site. In conclusion, the present data are the first to document that Foxn1 and Hif-1α cooperatively (1) regulate dWAT during the proliferative phase of skin wound healing through the Igf2 signaling pathway, and (2) reduce the macrophages content in the wound site.",experimental,

These therapies have been beneficial in treating wounds. We investigated the effectiveness of monotherapy with LTP, NPWT, and MSC and combination therapy with LTP + MSC, LTP + NPWT, NPWT + MSC, and LTP + NPWT + MSC on skin wounds in mice for seven consecutive days. Gene expression, protein expression, and epithelial thickness were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), respectively. Wound closure was also evaluated. Wound closure was significantly accelerated in monotherapy groups, whereas more accelerated in combination therapy groups. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression was increased in the LTP monotherapy group but decreased in the NPWT, MSC, and combination therapy groups. Expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and type I collagen were increased in the combination therapy groups. Re-epithelialization was also considerably accelerated in combination therapy groups.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the in vivo effects of ICOSL triggering by ICOS-Fc, a recombinant soluble form of ICOS, on skin wound healing. METHODS: The effect of human ICOS-Fc on wound healing was assessed, in vitro, and, in vivo, by skin wound healing assay using ICOS-/- and ICOSL-/- knockout (KO) mice and NOD-SCID-IL2R null (NSG) mice. RESULTS: We show that, in wild type mice, treatment with ICOS-Fc improves wound healing, promotes angiogenesis, preceded by upregulation of IL-6 and VEGF expression; increases the number of fibroblasts and T cells, whereas it reduces that of neutrophils; and increases the number of M2 vs. M1 macrophages. Fittingly, ICOS-Fc enhanced M2 macrophage migration, while it hampered that of M1 macrophages. ICOS-/- and ICOSL-/- KO, and NSG mice showed delayed wound healing, and treatment with ICOS-Fc improved wound closure in ICOS-/- and NSG mice. CONCLUSION: These data show that the ICOS/ICOSL network cooperates in tissue repair, and that triggering of ICOSL by ICOS-Fc improves cutaneous wound healing by increasing angiogenesis and recruitment of reparative macrophages.","experimental, number of mice in experiment not stated","suspicicous, worth to check actual paper"
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241914726,Effects of an Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Conditioned medium and TGF-β1 on Human Keratinocytes In Vitro,"Human keratinocytes play a crucial role during skin wound healing and in skin replacement therapies. The secretome of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) has been shown to secrete pro-healing factors, among which include TGF-β1, which is essential for keratinocyte migration and the re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds during skin wound healing. The benefits of an ASC conditioned medium (ASC-CM) are primarily orchestrated by trophic factors that mediate autocrine and paracrine effects in keratinocytes. Here, we evaluated the composition and the innate characteristics of the ASC secretome and its biological effects on keratinocyte maturation and wound healing in vitro. In particular, we detected high levels of different growth factors, such as HGF, FGFb, and VEGF, and other factors, such as TIMP1 and 4, IL8, PAI-1, uPA, and IGFBP-3, in the ASC-CM. Further, we investigated, using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, the distinct effects of a human ASC-CM and/or synthetic TGF-β1 on human keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and cell apoptosis suppression. We demonstrated that the ASC-CM increased keratinocyte proliferation as compared to TGF-β1 treatment. Further, we found that the ASC-CM exerted cell cycle progression in keratinocytes via regulating the phases G1, S, and G2/M. In particular, cells subjected to the ASC-CM demonstrated increased DNA synthesis (S phase) compared to the TGF-β1-treated KCs, which showed a pronounced G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, both the ASC-CM and TGF-β1 conditions resulted in a decreased expression of the late differentiation marker CK10 in human keratinocytes in vitro, whereas both treatments enhanced transglutaminase 3 and loricrin expression. Interestingly, the ASC-CM promoted significantly increased numbers of keratinocytes expressing epidermal basal keratinocyte markers, such DLL1 and Jagged2 Notch ligands, whereas those ligands were significantly decreased in TGF-β1-treated keratinocytes. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the ASC-CM is a potent stimulator of human keratinocyte proliferation in vitro, particularly supporting basal keratinocytes, which are crucial for a successful skin coverage after transplantation. In contrast, TGF-β1 treatment decreased keratinocyte proliferation and specifically increased the expression of differentiation markers in vitro.",experimental,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms22041933,Dermal Drivers of Injury-Induced Inflammation: Contribution of Adipocytes and Fibroblasts,"Irregular inflammatory responses are a major contributor to tissue dysfunction and inefficient repair. Skin has proven to be a powerful model to study mechanisms that regulate inflammation. In particular, skin wound healing is dependent on a rapid, robust immune response and subsequent dampening of inflammatory signaling. While injury-induced inflammation has historically been attributed to keratinocytes and immune cells, a vast body of evidence supports the ability of non-immune cells to coordinate inflammation in numerous tissues and diseases. In this review, we concentrate on the active participation of tissue-resident adipocytes and fibroblasts in pro-inflammatory signaling after injury, and how altered cellular communication from these cells can contribute to irregular inflammation associated with aberrant wound healing. Furthering our understanding of how tissue-resident mesenchymal cells contribute to inflammation will likely reveal new targets that can be manipulated to regulate inflammation and repair.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms19071956,"Foxn1 in Skin Development, Homeostasis and Wound Healing","Intensive research effort has focused on cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate skin biology, including the phenomenon of scar-free skin healing during foetal life. Transcription factors are the key molecules that tune gene expression and either promote or suppress gene transcription. The epidermis is the source of transcription factors that regulate many functions of epidermal cells such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. Furthermore, the activation of epidermal transcription factors also causes changes in the dermal compartment of the skin. This review focuses on the transcription factor Foxn1 and its role in skin biology. The regulatory function of Foxn1 in the skin relates to physiological (development and homeostasis) and pathological (skin wound healing) conditions. In particular, the pivotal role of Foxn1 in skin development and the acquisition of the adult skin phenotype, which coincides with losing the ability of scar-free healing, is discussed. Thus, genetic manipulations with Foxn1 expression, specifically those introducing conditional Foxn1 silencing in a Foxn1+/+ organism or its knock-in in a Foxn1−/− model, may provide future perspectives for regenerative medicine.",AM HERE,

Lupeol has been reported to possess different biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and in vitro wound healing properties, which motivated us to proceed with in vivo studies. We aimed to investigate the wound healing effect of lupeol-based cream for 3, 7, and 14 days. Wound excisions were induced on the thoraco-lumbar region of rats and topically treated immediately after injury induction. Macroscopic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA and gene expression was evaluated by real-time RT-qPCR. Our results showed a strong wound-healing effect of lupeol-based cream after 7 and 14 days. Lupeol treatment caused a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1β, and IL-6) and gene and protein NF-κB expression, and positively altered IL-10 levels, showing anti-inflammatory effects in the three treatment periods. Lupeol treatment showed involvement in the proliferative phase by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels, increasing the immunostaining of Ki-67 and gene expression, and immunolabeling of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), and increasing gene expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) after seven days of treatment. Lupeol was also involved in the tissue regeneration phase by increasing the synthesis of collagen fibers noted in the three treatment periods analyzed. Our findings suggest that lupeol may serve as a novel therapeutic option to treat cutaneous wounds by regulating mechanisms involved in the inflammatory, proliferative, and tissue-remodeling phases.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms22157804,Skin Wound Healing Rate in Fish Depends on Species and Microbiota,"The skin is a barrier between the body and the environment that protects the integrity of the body and houses a vast microbiota. By interacting with the host immune system, the microbiota improves wound healing in mammals. However, in fish, the evidence of the role of microbiota and the type of species on wound healing is scarce. We aimed to examine the wound healing rate in various fish species and evaluate the effect of antibiotics on the wound healing process. The wound healing rate was much faster in two of the seven fish species selected based on habitat and skin types. We also demonstrated that the composition of the microbiome plays a role in the wound healing rate. After antibiotic treatment, the wound healing rate improved in one species. Through 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified microbiome correlates of varying responses on wound healing after antibiotic treatment. These findings indicate that not only the species difference but also the microbiota play a significant role in wound healing in fish.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms18081675,Acceleration Mechanisms of Skin Wound Healing by Autologous Micrograft in Mice,"A micrograft technique, which minces tissue into micro-fragments >50 μm, has been recently developed. However, its pathophysiological mechanisms in wound healing are unclear yet. We thus performed a wound healing study using normal mice. A humanized mouse model of a skin wound with a splint was used. After total skin excision, tissue micro-fragments obtained by the Rigenera protocol were infused onto the wounds. In the cell tracing study, GFP-expressing green mice and SCID mice were used. Collagen stains including Picrosirius red (PSR) and immunohistological stains for α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), CD31, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and neutrophils were evaluated for granulation tissue development. GFP-positive cells remained in granulation tissue seven days after infusion, but vanished after 13 days. Following the infusion of the tissue micrograft solution onto the wound, TGF-β1 expression was transiently upregulated in granulation tissue in the early phase. Subsequently, αSMA-expressing myofibroblasts increased in number in thickened granulation tissue with acceleration of neovascularization and collagen matrix maturation. On such granulation tissue, regenerative epithelial healing progressed, resulting in wound area reduction. Alternative alteration after the micrograft may have increased αSMA-expressing myofibroblasts in granulation tissue, which may act on collagen accumulation, neovascularization and wound contraction. All of these changes are favorable for epithelial regeneration on wound.",,

Technological advancements are currently increasing the number of new adjunctive therapies that may be potent agents for speeding recovery, lowering the amputation rate and limiting infection recurrences. A novel formula with promising antibacterial activity, namely sericin/propolis/Amoxicillin nanoparticles, was assessed as a potent treatment of infected wounds in normal and diabetic rats. Skin wound healing efficiency was assessed through wound healing scorings, bacterial load assessment and histological examinations. It was revealed that upon using sericin/propolis/Amoxicillin nanoparticles, complete wound healing was successfully achieved after 10 and 15 days postinjury for nondiabetic and diabetic rats, respectively. However, the bacterial load in the induced infected wounds was extremely low (0-10 CFU/mL) after 15 days post-treatment. The histological studies revealed that the dermis was more organized with new matrix deposition, and mature collagen fibers were observed among the treated animal groups. The present study is the first preclinical study which reported the importance of silk sericin in the form of nano-sericin/propolis loaded with Amoxicillin as an effective treatment against bacterial wound infections.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24108688,Mesenchymal Stem Cells Pretreated with Collagen Promote Skin Wound-Healing,"The existing treatment modalities for skin injuries mainly include dressings, negative-pressure wound treatment, autologous skin grafting, and high-pressure wound treatment. All of these therapies have limitations such as high time cost, the inability to remove inactivated tissue in a timely manner, surgical debridement, and oxygen toxicity. Mesenchymal stem cells have a unique self-renewal ability and wide differentiation potential, and they are one of the most promising stem cell types in cell therapy and have great application prospects in the field of regenerative medicine. Collagen exerts structural roles by promoting the molecular structure, shape, and mechanical properties of cells, and adding it to cell cultures can also promote cell proliferation and shorten the cell doubling time. The effects of collagen on MSCs were examined using Giemsa staining, EdU staining, and growth curves. Mice were subjected to allogeneic experiments and autologous experiments to reduce individual differences; all animals were separated into four groups. Neonatal skin sections were detected by HE staining, Masson staining, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence staining. We found that the MSCs pretreated with collagen accelerated the healing of skin wounds in mice and canines by promoting epidermal layer repair, collagen deposition, hair follicle angiogenesis, and an inflammatory response. Collagen promotes the secretion of the chemokines and growth factors associated with skin healing by MSCs, which positively influences skin healing. This study supports the treatment of skin injuries with MSCs cultured in medium with collagen added.",,

The scaffold material as a template for tissue formation plays the most important role in TE. Among scaffold materials, silk fibroin (SF), a natural protein with outstanding mechanical properties, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and bioresorbability has attracted significant attention for TE applications. SF is commonly dissolved into an aqueous solution and can be easily reconstructed into different material formats, including films, mats, hydrogels, and sponges via various fabrication techniques. These include spin coating, electrospinning, freeze drying, physical, and chemical crosslinking techniques. Furthermore, to facilitate fabrication of more complex SF-based scaffolds with high precision techniques including micro-patterning and bio-printing have recently been explored. This review introduces the physicochemical and mechanical properties of SF and looks into a range of SF-based scaffolds that have been recently developed. The typical TE applications of SF-based scaffolds including bone, cartilage, ligament, tendon, skin, wound healing, and tympanic membrane, will be highlighted and discussed, followed by future prospects and challenges needing to be addressed.",,

A topical study shows the effect of the hydrogel application on surgically induced skin wound healing in a rat model. Contact angle measurements confirm hydrophilic behavior (11.37°), while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of functional groups related to the healing effectiveness (carboxylic acid and amine groups). Allantoin is distributed on the surface and inside the amorphous pectin hydrogel surrounded by a heterogeneous distribution of pores. This promotes wound drying with better interaction between the hydrogel and cells involved in the wound healing process. An experimental study with female Wistar rats indicates that the hydrogel improves wound contraction, reducing around 71.43% of the total healing time and reaching total wound closure in 15 days.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241814274,"Matricellular Proteins in the Homeostasis, Regeneration, and Aging of Skin","Matricellular proteins are secreted extracellular proteins that bear no primary structural functions but play crucial roles in tissue remodeling during development, homeostasis, and aging. Despite their low expression after birth, matricellular proteins within skin compartments support the structural function of many extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagens. In this review, we summarize the function of matricellular proteins in skin stem cell niches that influence stem cells' fate and self-renewal ability. In the epidermal stem cell niche, fibulin 7 promotes epidermal stem cells' heterogeneity and fitness into old age, and the transforming growth factor-β-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI)-enhances epidermal stem cell growth and wound healing. In the hair follicle stem cell niche, matricellular proteins such as periostin, tenascin C, SPARC, fibulin 1, CCN2, and R-Spondin 2 and 3 modulate stem cell activity during the hair cycle and may stabilize arrector pili muscle attachment to the hair follicle during piloerections (goosebumps). In skin wound healing, matricellular proteins are upregulated, and their functions have been examined in various gain-and-loss-of-function studies. However, much remains unknown concerning whether these proteins modulate skin stem cell behavior, plasticity, or cell-cell communications during wound healing and aging, leaving a new avenue for future studies.",,

CXCL1, a cytokine belonging to the CXC sub-family of chemokines with CXC motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) as its main receptor, causes the migration and infiltration of neutrophils to the sites of high expression. This implicates CXCL1 in many adverse conditions associated with inflammation and the accumulation of neutrophils. The aim of this study was to describe the significance of CXCL1 in selected diseases of the cardiovascular system (atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, chronic ischemic heart disease, hypertension, sepsis including sepsis-associated encephalopathy and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury), the respiratory system (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic rhinosinusitis, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza, lung transplantation and ischemic-reperfusion injury and tuberculosis) and the skin (wound healing, psoriasis, sunburn and xeroderma pigmentosum).

Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms232113414,MED1 Ablation Promotes Oral Mucosal Wound Healing via JNK Signaling Pathway,"Mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1) is a coactivator of multiple transcription factors and plays a key role in regulating epidermal homeostasis as well as skin wound healing. It is unknown, however, whether it plays a role in healing oral mucosal wounds. In this study, we investigate MED1's functional effects on oral mucosal wound healing and its underlying mechanism. The epithelial-specific MED1 null (Med1epi-/-) mice were established using the Cre-loxP system with C57/BL6 background. A 3 mm diameter wound was made in the cheek mucosa of the 8-week-old mice. In vivo experiments were conducted using HE staining and immunostaining with Ki67 and uPAR antibodies. The in vitro study used lentiviral transduction, scratch assays, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting to reveal the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that ablation of MED1 accelerated oral mucosal wound healing in 8-week-old mice. As a result of ablation of MED1, Activin A/Follistatin expression was altered, resulting in an activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. Similarly, knockdown of MED1 enhanced the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes in vitro, promoting re-epithelialization, which accelerates the healing of oral mucosal wounds. Our study reveals a novel role for MED1 in oral keratinocytes, providing a new molecular therapeutic target for accelerated wound healing.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms21020521,Site-Specific Expression Pattern of PIWI-Interacting RNA in Skin and Oral Mucosal Wound Healing,"The oral mucosa exhibits exceptional healing capability when compared to skin. Recent studies suggest that intrinsic differences in coding genes and regulatory small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) genes (e.g., microRNAs) may underlie the exceptional healing that occurs in the oral mucosa. Here, we investigate the role of a novel class of sncRNA-Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-in the tissue-specific differential response to injury. An abundance of piRNAs was detected in both skin and oral mucosal epithelium during wound healing. The expression of PIWI genes (the obligate binding partners of piRNAs) was also detected in skin and oral wound healing. This data suggested that PIWI-piRNA machinery may serve an unknown function in the highly orchestrated wound healing process. Furthermore, unique tissue-specific piRNA profiles were obtained in the skin and oral mucosal epithelium, and substantially more changes in piRNA expression were observed during skin wound healing than oral mucosal wound healing. Thus, we present the first clue suggesting a role of piRNA in wound healing, and provide the first site-specific piRNA profile of skin and oral mucosal wound healing. These results serve as a foundation for the future investigation of the functional contribution(s) of piRNA in wound repair and tissue regeneration.",,

However, the treatment of these remains challenging. Several studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment enhances skin wound healing. In this study, we extracted human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from patients and generated an in vitro radiation-induced skin injury model with HDFs to verify the effect of conditioned medium derived from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-CM) and extracellular vesicles derived from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-EVs) on the healing of radiation-induced skin injury. The results showed that collagen synthesis was significantly increased in wounds treated with ADSC-CM or ADSC-EVs compared with the control group, which promoted the expression of collagen-related genes and suppressed the expression of inflammation-related genes. These findings indicated that treatment with ADSC-CM or ADSC-EVs suppressed inflammation and promoted extracellular matrix deposition; treatment with ADSC-EVs also promoted fibroblast proliferation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of ADSC-CM and ADSC-EVs in the healing of radiation-induced skin injury.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24043213,Lamprey Wound Healing and Regenerative Effects: The Collaborative Efforts of Diverse Drivers,"Skin is a natural barrier between the body and the external environment, and this important multifunctional organ plays roles in body temperature regulation, sensory stimulation, mucus secretion, metabolite excretion and immune defense. Lampreys, as ancient vertebrates, rarely experience infection of damaged skin during farming and efficiently promote skin wound healing. However, the mechanism underlying these wound healing and regenerative effects is unclear. Our histology and transcriptomics results demonstrate that lampreys regenerate a nearly complete skin structure in damaged epidermis, including the secretory glands, and will almost not be infected, even if experiencing full-thickness damage. In addition, ATGL, DGL and MGL participate in the lipolysis process to provide space for infiltrating cells. A large number of red blood cells migrate to the site of injury and exert proinflammatory effects, upregulating the expression of proinflammatory factors such as IL-8 and IL-17. Based on a lamprey skin damage healing model, adipocytes and red blood cells in the subcutaneous fat layer can promote wound healing, which provides a new approach for the study of skin healing mechanisms. Transcriptome data reveal that mechanical signal transduction pathways are mainly regulated by focal adhesion kinase and that the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in the healing of lamprey skin injuries. We identified RAC1 as a key regulatory gene that is necessary and partially sufficient for wound regeneration. Insights into the mechanisms of lamprey skin injury and healing will provide a theoretical basis for overcoming the challenges associated with chronic healing and scar healing in the clinic.",,

Reduced wound healing times would improve clinical, economic, and social aspects for both patients and the healthcare system. Skin wound healing has been studied for years, but effective therapy that leads to accelerated wound healing remains to be discovered. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of MELK silencing to accelerate wound healing. A vectorless, transient knockdown of the MELK gene using siRNA was performed in a murine skin wound model. The wound size, total collagen, type 3 collagen, vessel size, vessel number, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, number of mast cells, and immune infiltration by CD45, CD11b, CD45, and CD8a cells were evaluated. We observed that treatment with MELK siRNA leads to significantly faster wound closing associated with increased collagen deposition.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms17121984,DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 4 Is an Innate Surveillant of Hair Follicular Stress in Vitamin D Receptor Knockout Mice and a Regulator of Wound Re-Epithelialization,"Mice and human patients with impaired vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling have normal developmental hair growth but display aberrant post-morphogenic hair cycle progression associated with alopecia. In addition, VDR-/- mice exhibit impaired cutaneous wound healing. We undertook experiments to determine whether the stress-inducible regulator of energy homeostasis, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (Ddit4), is involved in these processes. By analyzing hair cycle activation in vivo, we show that VDR-/- mice at day 14 exhibit increased Ddit4 expression within follicular stress compartments. At day 29, degenerating VDR-/- follicular keratinocytes, but not bulge stem cells, continue to exhibit an increase in Ddit4 expression. At day 47, when normal follicles and epidermis are quiescent and enriched for Ddit4, VDR-/- skin lacks Ddit4 expression. In a skin wound healing assay, the re-epithelialized epidermis in wildtype (WT) but not VDR-/- animals harbor a population of Ddit4- and Krt10-positive cells. Our study suggests that VDR regulates Ddit4 expression during epidermal homeostasis and the wound healing process, while elevated Ddit4 represents an early growth-arresting stress response within VDR-/- follicles.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms22083851,Differential Therapeutic Effect of Extracellular Vesicles Derived by Bone Marrow and Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Wound Healing of Diabetic Ulcers and Correlation to Their Cargoes,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells isolated from both bone marrow (BMSCs) and adipose tissue (ADSCs) show potential therapeutic effects. These vesicles often show a similar beneficial effect on tissue regeneration, but in some contexts, they exert different biological properties. To date, a comparison of their molecular cargo that could explain the different biological effect is not available. Here, we demonstrated that ADSC-EVs, and not BMSC-EVs, promote wound healing on a murine model of diabetic wounds. Besides a general similarity, the bioinformatic analysis of their protein and miRNA cargo highlighted important differences between these two types of EVs. Molecules present exclusively in ADSC-EVs were highly correlated to angiogenesis, whereas those expressed in BMSC-EVs were preferentially involved in cellular proliferation. Finally, in vitro analysis confirmed that both ADSC and BMSC-EVs exploited beneficial effect on cells involved in skin wound healing such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells, but through different cellular processes. Consistent with the bioinformatic analyses, BMSC-EVs were shown to mainly promote proliferation, whereas ADSC-EVs demonstrated a major effect on angiogenesis. Taken together, these results provide deeper comparative information on the cargo of ADSC-EVs and BMSC-EVs and the impact on regenerative processes essential for diabetic wound healing.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24076269,Actinomycin-X2-Immobilized Silk Fibroin Film with Enhanced Antimicrobial and Wound Healing Activities,"Actinomycin is a family of chromogenic lactone peptides that differ in their peptide portions of the molecule. An antimicrobial peptide, actinomycin X2 (Ac.X2), was produced through the fermentation of a Streptomyces cyaneofuscatus strain. Immobilization of Ac.X2 onto a prepared silk fibroin (SF) film was done through a carbodiimide reaction. The physical properties of immobilized Ac.X2 (antimicrobial films, AMFs) were analyzed by ATR-FTIR, SEM, AFM, and WCA. The findings from an in vitro study showed that AMFs had a more broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli compared with free Ac.X2, which showed no apparent strong effect against E. coli. These AMFs showed a suitable degradation rate, good hemocompatibility, and reduced cytotoxicity in the biocompatibility assay. The results of in vivo bacterially infected wound healing experiments indicated that wound inflammation was prevented by AMFs, which promoted wound repair and improved the wound microenvironment. This study revealed that Ac.X2 transformation is a potential candidate for skin wound healing.",,

Although the health benefits attributed to Nitrodi's water are numerous, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. In this study, we aim to analyze the physicochemical properties and biological effects of Nitrodi's water on human dermal fibroblasts to determine whether the water exerts in vitro effects that could be relevant to skin wound healing. The results obtained from the study indicate that Nitrodi's water exerts strong promotional effects on dermal fibroblast viability and a significant stimulatory activity on cell migration. Nitrodi's water induces alpha-SMA expression in dermal fibroblasts, thus promoting their transition to myofibroblast-protein ECM deposition. Furthermore, Nitrodi's water reduces intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play an important role in human skin aging and dermal damage. Unsurprisingly, Nitrodi's water has significant stimulatory effects on the cell proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and inhibits the basal ROS production but enhances their response to the oxidative stress caused by external stimuli. Our results will contribute to the development of human clinical trials and further in vitro studies to identify inorganic and/or organic compounds responsible for pharmacological effects.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24098089,"Differential Effects of Overexpression of Wild Type and Kinase-Dead MELK in Fibroblasts and Keratinocytes, Potential Implications for Skin Wound Healing and Cancer","Maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) plays a significant role in cell cycle progression, mitosis, cell migration, cell renewal, gene expression, embryogenesis, proliferation, apoptosis, and spliceosome assembly. In addition, MELK is known to be overexpressed in multiple types of cancer and is associated with cancer proliferation. Tumorigenesis shares many similarities with wound healing, in which the rate of cell proliferation is a critical factor. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the involvement of MELK in the regulation of cell division in two cell types involved in this process, namely fibroblasts and keratinocytes. We examined how temporal overexpression of wild-type and kinase-dead MELK kinase variants affect the rate of proliferation, viability, cell cycle, and phosphorylation state of other kinases involved in these processes, such as ERK1/2, AKT1, MAPK9, p38, and p53. We explored if MELK could be used as a therapeutic stimulator of accelerated wound healing via increased proliferation. We observed that aberrant expression of MELK results in abnormal proliferation, altered cell cycle distribution, and decreased viability of the cells, which challenge the utility of MELK in accelerated wound healing. Our results indicate that, at least in healthy cells, any deviation from precisely controlled MELK expression is harmful to fibroblasts and keratinocytes.",,

Natural antioxidants show interesting wound-healing properties, including those extracted from waste derived from olive oil production. Olive mill wastewater is one of the main by-products of the olive oil-making process, and it is rich in high-value secondary metabolites, mainly hydroxytyrosol. We proposed an eco-friendly extraction method, employing both ultrasound-assisted and Soxhlet techniques and ethanol as a solvent, to recover valuable molecules from Roggianella cv (Olea europea L.) olive mill wastewater, which was further entrapped in a pectin polymer via an enzymatic reaction using porcine pancreatic lipase. Pectin, in combination with other substances, promoted and accelerated wound healing and demonstrated good potential to produce a biomedical conjugate for wound treatment. The antioxidant activity of the extracts and conjugate were evaluated against lipophilic (IC50 equal to 0.152 mg mL-1) and hydrophilic (IC50 equal to 0.0371 mg mL-1) radical species as well as the in vitro cytotoxicity via NRU, h-CLAT, and a wound-healing scratch assay and assessment. The pectin conjugate did not exert hemolytic effects on the peripheral blood, demonstrating interesting wound-healing properties due to its ability to stimulate cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms22115469,Effect of Pig-Adipose-Derived Stem Cells' Conditioned Media on Skin Wound-Healing Characteristics In Vitro,"The primary mechanism by which adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exert their reparative or regenerative potential relies predominantly on paracrine action. Secretory abilities of ASCs have been found to be amplified by hypoxia pre-conditioning. This study investigates the impact of hypoxia (1% O2) on the secretome composition of pig ASCs (pASCs) and explores the effect of pASCs' conditioned media (CM) on skin cell functions in vitro and the expression of markers attributed to wound healing. Exposure of pASCs to hypoxia increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CM-Hyp compared to CM collected from the cells cultured in normoxia (CM-Nor). CM-Hyp promoted the migratory ability of pig keratinocytes (pKERs) and delayed migration of pig dermal fibroblasts (pDFs). Exposure of pKERs to either CM-Nor or CM-Hyp decreased the levels of pro-fibrotic indicators WNT10A and WNT11. Furthermore, CM-Hyp enhanced the expression of KRT14, the marker of the basal epidermis layer. In contrast, CM-Nor showed a stronger effect on pDFs manifested by increases in TGFB1, COL1A1, COL3A1, and FN1 mRNA expression. The formation of three-dimensional endothelial cell networks was improved in the presence of CM-Hyp. Overall, our results demonstrate that the paracrine activity of pASCs affects skin cells, and this property might be used to modulate wound healing.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms19041034,The Role of Serotonin during Skin Healing in Post-Thermal Injury,"Post-burn trauma significantly raises tissue serotonin concentration at the initial stages of injury, which leads us to investigate its possible role in post burn wound healing. Therefore, we planned this study to examine the role of serotonin in wound healing through in vitro and in vivo models of burn injuries. Results from in vitro analysis revealed that serotonin decreased apoptosis and increased cell survival significantly in human fibroblasts and neonatal keratinocytes. Cellular proliferation also increased significantly in both cell types. Moreover, serotonin stimulation significantly accelerated the cell migration, resulting in narrowing of the scratch zone in human neonatal keratinocytes and fibroblasts cultures. Whereas, fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and ketanserin (serotonin receptor 2A inhibitor) reversed these effects. Scald burn mice model (20% total body surface area) showed that endogenous serotonin improved wound healing process in control group, whereas fluoxetine and ketanserin treatments (disruptors of endogenous serotonin stimulation), resulted in poor reepithelization, bigger wound size and high alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) count. All of these signs refer a prolonged differentiation state, which ultimately exhibits poor wound healing outcomes. Collectively, data showed that the endogenous serotonin pathway contributes to regulating the skin wound healing process. Hence, the results of this study signify the importance of serotonin as a potential therapeutic candidate for enhancing skin healing in burn patients.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24087160,The Regulatory Mechanism of Cold Plasma in Relation to Cell Activity and Its Application in Biomedical and Animal Husbandry Practices,"As an innovative technology in biological applications, cold plasma is widely used in oral treatment, tissue regeneration, wound healing, and cancer therapy, etc., because of the adjustable composition and temperature which allow the plasma to react with bio-objects safely. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by cold plasma regulate cell activity in an intensity- and time-dependent manner. A low level of ROS produced by cold plasma treatment within the appropriate intensities and times promotes proliferation of skin-related cells and increases angiogenesis, which aid in the acceleration of the wound healing process, while a high level of ROS produced by cold plasma treatment performed at a high intensity or over a long period of time inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and cancer cells. Moreover, cold plasma can regulate stem cell proliferation by changing niche interface and producing nitric oxide directly. However, the molecular mechanism of cold plasma regulating cell activity and its potential application in the field of animal husbandry remain unclear in the literature. Therefore, this paper reviews the effects and possible regulatory mechanisms of cold plasma on the activities of endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, stem cells, and cancer cells to provide a theoretical basis for the application of cold plasma to skin-wound healing and cancer therapy. In addition, cold plasma exposure at a high intensity or an extended time shows excellent performances in killing various microorganisms existing in the environment or on the surface of animal food, and preparing inactivated vaccines, while cold plasma treatment within the appropriate conditions improves chicken growth and reproductive capacity. This paper introduces the potential applications of cold plasma treatment in relation to animal-breeding environments, animal health, their growth and reproduction, and animal food processing and preservation, which are all beneficial to the practice of animal husbandry and guarantee good animal food safety results.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms231810650,Cold Atmospheric Plasma Jet Treatment Improves Human Keratinocyte Migration and Wound Closure Capacity without Causing Cellular Oxidative Stress,"Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) is an emerging technology with great potential for biomedical applications such as sterilizing equipment and antitumor strategies. CAP has also been shown to improve skin wound healing in vivo, but the biological mechanisms involved are not well known. Our study assessed a possible effect of a direct helium jet CAP treatment on keratinocytes, in both the immortalized N/TERT-1 human cell line and primary keratinocytes obtained from human skin samples. The cells were covered with 200 µL of phosphate buffered saline and exposed to the helium plasma jet for 10−120 s. In our experimental conditions, micromolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, nitrite and nitrate were produced. We showed that long-time CAP treatments (≥60 s) were cytotoxic, reduced keratinocyte migration, upregulated the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and induced oxidative cell stress. In contrast, short-term CAP treatments (<60 s) were not cytotoxic, did not affect keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and did not induce any changes in mitochondria, but they did accelerate wound closure in vitro by improving keratinocyte migration. In conclusion, these results suggest that helium-based CAP treatments improve wound healing by stimulating keratinocyte migration. The study confirms that CAP could be a novel therapeutic method to treat recalcitrant wounds.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms23147663,Effect of Polymeric Nanoparticles with Entrapped Fish Oil or Mupirocin on Skin Wound Healing Using a Porcine Model,"The utilization of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) with entrapped fish oil (FO) loaded in collagen-based scaffolds for cutaneous wound healing using a porcine model is unique for the present study. Full-depth cutaneous excisions (5 × 5 cm) on the pig dorsa were treated with pure collagen scaffold (control, C), empty PLGA NPs (NP), FO, mupirocin (MUP), PLGA NPs with entrapped FO (NP/FO) and PLGA NPs with entrapped MUP (NP/MUP). The following markers were evaluated on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21 post-excision: collagen, hydroxyproline (HP), angiogenesis and expressions of the COX2, EGF, COL1A1, COL1A3, TGFB1, VEGFA, CCL5 and CCR5 genes. The hypothesis that NP/FO treatment is superior to FO alone and that it is comparable to NP/MUP was tested. NP/FO treatment increased HP in comparison with both FO alone and NP/MUP (day 14) but decreased (p < 0.05) angiogenesis in comparison with FO alone (day 3). NP/FO increased (p < 0.05) the expression of the CCR5 gene (day 3) and tended (p > 0.05) to increase the expressions of the EGF (day 7, day 14), TGFB1 (day 21) and CCL5 (day 7, day 21) genes as compared with NP/MUP. NP/FO can be suggested as a suitable alternative to NP/MUP in cutaneous wound treatment.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms20153679,Overexpression of the Oral Mucosa-Specific microRNA-31 Promotes Skin Wound Closure,"Wounds within the oral mucosa are known to heal more rapidly than skin wounds. Recent studies suggest that differences in the microRNAome profiles may underlie the exceptional healing that occurs in oral mucosa. Here, we test whether skin wound-healing can be accelerating by increasing the levels of oral mucosa-specific microRNAs. A panel of 57 differentially expressed high expresser microRNAs were identified based on our previously published miR-seq dataset of paired skin and oral mucosal wound-healing [Sci. Rep. (2019) 9:7160]. These microRNAs were further grouped into 5 clusters based on their expression patterns, and their differential expression was confirmed by TaqMan-based quantification of LCM-captured epithelial cells from the wound edges. Of these 5 clusters, Cluster IV (consisting of 8 microRNAs, including miR-31) is most intriguing due to its tissue-specific expression pattern and temporal changes during wound-healing. The in vitro functional assays show that ectopic transfection of miR-31 consistently enhanced keratinocyte proliferation and migration. In vivo, miR-31 mimic treatment led to a statistically significant acceleration of wound closure. Our results demonstrate that wound-healing can be enhanced in skin through the overexpression of microRNAs that are highly expressed in the privileged healing response of the oral mucosa.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241310701,Skin Wound following Irradiation Aggravates Radiation-Induced Brain Injury in a Mouse Model,"Radiation injury- and radiation combined with skin injury-induced inflammatory responses in the mouse brain were evaluated in this study. Female B6D2F1/J mice were subjected to a sham, a skin wound (SW), 9.5 Gy 60Co total-body gamma irradiation (RI), or 9.5 Gy RI combined with a skin puncture wound (RCI). Survival, body weight, and wound healing were tracked for 30 days, and mouse brain samples were collected on day 30 after SW, RI, RCI, and the sham control. Our results showed that RCI caused more severe animal death and body weight loss compared with RI, and skin wound healing was significantly delayed by RCI compared to SW. RCI and RI increased the chemokines Eotaxin, IP-10, MIG, 6Ckine/Exodus2, MCP-5, and TIMP-1 in the brain compared to SW and the sham control mice, and the Western blot results showed that IP-10 and p21 were significantly upregulated in brain cells post-RI or -RCI. RI and RCI activated both astrocytes and endothelial cells in the mouse brain, subsequently inducing blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, as shown by the increased ICAM1 and GFAP proteins in the brain and GFAP in the serum. The Doublecortin (DCX) protein, the ""gold standard"" for measuring neurogenesis, was significantly downregulated by RI and RCI compared with the sham group. Furthermore, RI and RCI decreased the expression of the neural stem cell marker E-cadherin, the intermediate progenitor marker MASH1, the immature neuron cell marker NeuroD1, and the mature neuron cell marker NeuN, indicating neural cell damage in all development stages after RI and RCI. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining further confirmed the significant loss of neural cells in RCI. Our data demonstrated that RI and RCI induced brain injury through inflammatory pathways, and RCI exacerbated neural cell damage more than RI.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms20194932,"Cloning, Expression and Effects of P. americana Thymosin on Wound Healing","The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) is a medicinal insect. Its extract is used clinically to promote wound healing and tissue regeneration, but the effective medicinal components and mechanisms are not yet clear. It has been reported that human thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4) may accelerate skin wound healing, however, the role of P. americana thymosin (Pa-THYs) is still poorly understood. In the present study, we identify and analyze the DNA sequences of Pa-THYs by bioinformatics analysis. Then we clone, express, and purify the Pa-THYs proteins and evaluate the activity of recombinant Pa-THYs proteins by cell migration and proliferation assays in NIH/3T3 cells. To elucidate the role of Pa-THYs in wound healing, a mouse model is established, and we evaluate wound contraction, histopathological parameters, and the expressions of several key growth factors after Pa-THYs treatment. Our results showed that three THY variants were formed by skipping splicing of exons. Pa-THYs could promote fibroblast migration, but have no effect on fibroblast proliferation. In wound repair, Pa-THYs proteins could effectively promote wound healing through stimulating dermal tissue regeneration, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition. On the molecular mechanism, Pa-THYs also stimulated the expression of several key growth factors to promote wound healing. The data suggest that Pa-THYs could be a potential drug for promoting wound repair.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241814094,Gintonin-Induced Wound-Healing-Related Responses Involve Epidermal-Growth-Factor-like Effects in Keratinocytes,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation and related downstream signaling pathways are known to be one of the major mechanisms of the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. The heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) binds to EGF receptors and stimulates keratinocyte proliferation and migration. Gintonin, a novel ginseng compound, is a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand. Gintonin has skin-wound-healing effects. However, the underlying mechanisms for these gintonin actions remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the involvement of EGFRs in gintonin-induced wound repair in HaCaT keratinocytes. In this study, a water-soluble tetrazolium salt-based assay, a modified Boyden chamber migration assay, and immunoblotting were performed. Gintonin increased EGF receptor activation in HaCaT cells. However, the gintonin-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was markedly reduced via treatment with the LPA inhibitor Ki16425 or the EGF receptor inhibitor erlotinib. Gintonin-enhanced proliferation and migration were blocked by the EGF receptor inhibitors (erlotinib and AG1478). Additionally, gintonin stimulated the expression and release of HB-EGF in HaCaT cells. EGF receptor inhibitors blocked gintonin-enhanced HB-EGF expression. These results indicate that the wound-healing effects of gintonin are closely related to the collaboration between EGF receptor activation and HB-EGF release-mediated downstream signaling pathways.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms241713328,"Comparative Study of the Efficacy of EHO-85, a Hydrogel Containing Olive Tree (Olea europaea) Leaf Extract, in Skin Wound Healing","Olive tree (Olea europaea) leaf extract (OELE) has important antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, supporting its use in human clinical practice. We recently designed an amorphous hydrogel called EHO-85 (EHO indicates olive leaf extract in Spanish) containing OELE for skin ulcer treatments. Yet, its effectiveness has not been previously compared with other products used in routine clinical practice. This is necessary to evaluate its potential translation to the human clinic. Thus, in this study, the effect of EHO-85 on healing was evaluated in comparison with treatments containing Indian/Asiatic pennywort (Centella asiatica), hyaluronic acid, or dexpanthenol in a rat model. The speed of wound closure and histological parameters after seven and 14 days were analyzed. All treatments accelerated wound closure, but there were differences between them. Dexpanthenol after seven days produced the highest epithelialization and the lowest inflammation and vascularization. EHO-85 also promoted epithelialization and reduced vascularization. After 14 days, wounds treated with EHO-85 showed less inflammation and higher levels of collagen in the extracellular matrix. This indicates a higher degree of maturity in the regenerated tissue. In conclusion, the effect of EHO-85 on healing was equal to or superior to that of other treatments routinely used in human clinical practice. Therefore, these results, together with previous data on the effects of this hydrogel on ulcer healing in humans, indicate that EHO-85 is a suitable, low-cost, and efficient therapeutic option for wound healing.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24021304,Zinc- and Copper-Doped Mesoporous Borate Bioactive Glasses: Promising Additives for Potential Use in Skin Wound Healing Applications,"In this study, zinc (Zn)- and copper (Cu)-doped 13-93B3 borate mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs) were successfully synthesized using nitrate precursors in the presence of Pluronic P123. We benefited from computational approaches for predicting and confirming the experimental findings. The changes in the dynamic surface tension (SFT) of simulated body fluid (SBF) were investigated using the Du Noüy ring method to shed light on the mineralization process of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on the glass surface. The obtained MBGs were in a glassy state before incubation in SBF. The formation of an apatite-like layer on the SBF-incubated borate glasses was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The incorporation of Zn and Cu into the basic composition of 13-93B3 glass led to changes in the glass transition temperature (Tg) (773 to 556 °C), particle size (373 to 64 nm), zeta potential (−12 to −26 mV), and specific surface area (SBET) (54 to 123 m2/g). Based on the K-means algorithm and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) tree, we found that the SFT of SBF is an important factor for the prediction and confirmation of the HAp mineralization process on the glasses. Furthermore, we proposed a simple calculation, based on SFT variation, to quantify the bioactivity of MBGs. The doped and dopant-free borate MBGs could enhance the proliferation of mouse fibroblast L929 cells at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. These glasses also induced very low hemolysis (<5%), confirming good compatibility with red blood cells. The results of the antibacterial test revealed that all the samples could significantly decrease the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In summary, we showed that Cu-/Zn-doped borate MBGs can be fabricated using a cost-effective method and also show promise for wound healing/skin tissue engineering applications, as especially supported by the cell test with fibroblasts, good compatibility with blood, and antibacterial properties.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms24054607,Flavonoids as Potential Wound-Healing Molecules: Emphasis on Pathways Perspective,"Wounds are considered to be a serious problem that affects the healthcare sector in many countries, primarily due to diabetes and obesity. Wounds become worse because of unhealthy lifestyles and habits. Wound healing is a complicated physiological process that is essential for restoring the epithelial barrier after an injury. Numerous studies have reported that flavonoids possess wound-healing properties due to their well-acclaimed anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and antioxidant effects. They have been shown to be able to act on the wound-healing process via expression of biomarkers respective to the pathways that mainly include Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo, Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β), Hedgehog, c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK), NF-E2-related factor 2/antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2/ARE), Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB), MAPK/ERK, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, Nitric oxide (NO) pathways, etc. Hence, we have compiled existing evidence on the manipulation of flavonoids towards achieving skin wound healing, together with current limitations and future perspectives in support of these polyphenolic compounds as safe wound-healing agents, in this review.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms20194727,In Vitro Evaluation of Novel Hybrid Cooperative Complexes in a Wound Healing Model: A Step Toward Improved Bioreparation,"The effectiveness of hyaluronic acid (HA), also called as hyaluronan, and its formulations on tissue regeneration and epidermal disease is well-documented. High-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HHA) is an efficient space filler that maintains hydration, serves as a substrate for proteoglycan assembly, and is involved in wound healing. Recently, an innovative hybrid cooperative complex (HCC) of high- and low-molecular-weight hyaluronan was developed that is effective in wound healing and bioremodeling. The HCC proposed here consisted of a new formulation and contained 1.6 ± 0.1 kDa HHA and 250 ± 7 kDa LHA (low molecular weight hyaluronic acid). We investigated the performance of this HCC in a novel in vitro HaCaT (immortalized human keratinocytes)/HDF (human dermal fibroblast) co-culture model to assess its ability to repair skin tissue lesions. Compared to linear HA samples, HCC reduced the biomarkers of inflammation (Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β), Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8)), and accelerated the healing process. These data were confirmed by the modulation of metalloproteases (MMPs) and elastin, and were compatible with a prospectively reduced risk of scar formation. We also examined the expression of defensin-2, an antimicrobial peptide, in the presence of hyaluronan, showing a higher expression in the HCC-treated samples and suggesting a potential increase in antibacterial and immunomodulatory functions. Based on these in vitro data, the presence of HCC in creams or dressings would be expected to enhance the resolution of inflammation and accelerate the skin wound healing process.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms15010605,Hypoxic conditioned medium from human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells accelerates skin wound healing through TGF-β/SMAD2 and PI3K/Akt pathways,"In a previous study, we isolated human amniotic fluid (AF)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs) and utilized normoxic conditioned medium (AF-MSC-norCM) which has been shown to accelerate cutaneous wound healing. Because hypoxia enhances the wound healing function of mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (MSC-CM), it is interesting to explore the mechanism responsible for the enhancement of wound healing function. In this work, hypoxia not only increased the proliferation of AF-MSCs but also maintained their constitutive characteristics (surface marker expression and differentiation potentials). Notably, more paracrine factors, VEGF and TGF-β1, were secreted into hypoxic conditioned medium from AF-MSCs (AF-MSC-hypoCM) compared to AF-MSC-norCM. Moreover, AF-MSC-hypoCM enhanced the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts in vitro, and wound closure in a skin injury model, as compared to AF-MSC-norCM. However, the enhancement of migration of fibroblasts accelerated by AF-MSC-hypoCM was inhibited by SB505124 and LY294002, inhibitors of TGF-β/SMAD2 and PI3K/AKT, suggesting that AF-MSC-hypoCM-enhanced wound healing is mediated by the activation of TGF-β/SMAD2 and PI3K/AKT. Therefore, AF-MSC-hypoCM enhances wound healing through the increase of hypoxia-induced paracrine factors via activation of TGF-β/SMAD2 and PI3K/AKT pathways.",,
Int J Mol Sci,10.3390/ijms23169346,"Macrophage-Specific, Mafb-Deficient Mice Showed Delayed Skin Wound Healing","Macrophages play essential roles throughout the wound repair process. Nevertheless, mechanisms regulating the process are poorly understood. MAFB is specifically expressed in the macrophages in hematopoietic tissue and is vital to homeostatic function. Comparison of the skin wound repair rates in macrophage-specific, MAFB-deficient mice (Mafbf/f::LysM-Cre) and control mice (Mafbf/f) showed that wound healing was significantly delayed in the former. For wounded GFP knock-in mice with GFP inserts in the Mafb locus, flow cytometry revealed that their GFP-positive cells expressed macrophage markers. Thus, macrophages express Mafb at wound sites. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, proteome analysis, and RT-qPCR of the wound tissue showed relative downregulation of Arg1, Ccl12, and Ccl2 in Mafbf/f::LysM-Cre mice. The aforementioned genes were also downregulated in the bone marrow-derived, M2-type macrophages of Mafbf/f::LysM-Cre mice. Published single-cell RNA-Seq analyses showed that Arg1, Ccl2, Ccl12, and Il-10 were expressed in distinct populations of MAFB-expressing cells. Hence, the MAFB-expressing macrophage population is heterogeneous. MAFB plays the vital role of regulating multiple genes implicated in wound healing, which suggests that MAFB is a potential therapeutic target in wound healing.",,
